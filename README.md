The portfolio is divided into five sections as follows:

1. **Home** - Title page with navigation
2. **About** - Snapshot of developers background and contact details.

## Future Developments
The contact page displaying a map location using google maps would complement the address details for anyone wishing to visit or simply to have an idea of the geographical location. Some animation could be added to make the pages come alive. Finally, additional pages could be added to provide additional information e.g. display developer skills and proficiency.

This project was put together using react components and made use of html, css, fortawesome fonts and icons, hooks, EmailJs and many other technologies. The project shows how react technologies can render a sophisticated application using minimal codde.

## Github Repository
